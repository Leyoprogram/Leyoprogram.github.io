	<h5> I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU. <h5>
	<p><font face="Bookman old style"> 
	You've seen every side of me <BR>
	You know how to calm me down, <BR>
	cheer me up, keep me smiling, better yet <BR>
	You didn't walk out on me <BR>
	When i know other people would have..<BR><BR>
	
	Your company brings me so much happiness and comfort <BR>
	Your personality and your affection <BR>
	makes me love you more each day. <BR>
	I love the time we spend together and<BR>
	i treasure the things you share with me. <BR><BR>
	
	You'll always be the person <BR>
	that i love the most in this world. <BR>
	Nothing could ever compare <BR>
	to the i love you i have for you. <BR><BR>
	
	You were an unexpected surprise, <BR>
	The defining moment. The collision of stars <BR>
	that slammed into me hard and sent my neat <BR>
	little world plummeting into the ocean. <BR><BR>
	
	I never expected it to be you, <BR>
	I will be Grateful <BR>
	Every day i have you in <BR>
	My life because so much <BR>
	things could have kept us <BR>
	From meeting each other, <BR>
	From being together, or <BR>
	Just from being alive at <BR>
	This exact moment in time <BR><BR>
	
	I will forever be grateful that somehow,<BR>
	In this infinite universe <BR>
	We found each other and i will always be grateful for that <BR><BR>
	
	I love you so much jaja.<BR>
